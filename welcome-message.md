Hey there!

Thank you so much for attending ULHacks! I'm the ULHacks Bot, which helps manage the ULHacks Discord Server. The ULHacks Discord Server will serve as the main communication platform for our event, where you'll be able to communicate with sponsors, organizers, and other hackers!

However, before you are given full access to the server, you need to register for our hackathon, which you can do by following the instructions below! If you have any questions, please either DM an @Organizer or send me (the ULHacks Bot) a message containing the `$message` command followed by your message and an organizer will get back to you as soon as possible! (Example: `$message I can't access the google form`)

__**If you're a hacker (participant):**__
To help keep this community safe and welcoming, we first need you to register using the following Google Form before you can participate in our event: https://forms.gle/w2SZHj8HbZ7xqN537

Once you've filled out the form, please send me a message with the message `$hacker` and an organizer will verify you as soon as possible!

**Note:** When you're registering through the Google Form, make sure to put the Discord tag that belongs to the Discord account you're joining this server with-this is how we will verify you. To retrieve your Discord tag, you can click on your profile name in the bottom left of the Discord window which will copy your Discord tag into your clipboard.

__**If you're a mentor, sponsor, workshop host, or a judge:**__
Please send me a message containing `$register` followed by your name and a description of your role. For example, if you were hosting a Web Development workshop, you would send a message like:
```
$register Leon Si - web development workshop host
```
Then, an organizer will give you the appropriate role as soon as possible!
